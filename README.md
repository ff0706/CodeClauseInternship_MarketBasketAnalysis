I worked on Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm which helps businesses gain valuable insights into customer behavior and to uncover associations between products frequently purchased together by customers, ultimately leading to improved sales and customer satisfaction.
Market Basket Analysis, a data mining technique widely used in retail and e-commerce industries to uncover associations between products frequently purchased together by customers. This analysis helps businesses understand customer behavior, enhance product placement strategies, and improve cross-selling and upselling efforts.
In this code:
We start by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas, mlxtend, and the specific functions needed for Apriori.
Mlxtend used two way based approach which generate frequent itemset and association rules over that. Mlxtend are proper and has community support.
Apriori is a classic algorithm for finding frequent itemsets in transaction data. A frequent itemset is a set of items that occur together in transactions with a frequency above a specified minimum support threshold. In the provided code, a minimum support of 0.07 is used, but you can adjust this threshold based on your analysis requirements.
The output of the Apriori algorithm is a list of frequent itemsets, along with their support values. Support measures how often an itemset appears in the transactions. Frequent itemsets are those that meet the minimum support threshold. These itemsets represent groups of items that are frequently bought together by customers.
After finding frequent itemsets, association rules are generated from them. Association rules express relationships between items in terms of their support and lift. In the code, a minimum lift threshold of 1.0 is used to filter the rules. Lift measures how much more likely one item is to be purchased when another item is already in the basket. By analyzing these rules, businesses can make informed decisions about product placement, marketing campaigns, and recommendations to encourage cross-selling and upselling.
The analysis results in a list of frequent itemsets and associated rules. These results can be interpreted to make data-driven decisions to improve business strategies, such as placing related items together on store shelves or suggesting complementary products to customers during online shopping.
